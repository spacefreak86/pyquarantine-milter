# pyquarantine-milter
A pymilter based sendmail/postfix pre-queue filter with the ability to ...
* modify e-mail headers (add, modify, delete)
* store e-mails
* send e-mail notifications
* append and prepend disclaimers to e-mail text parts
* quarantine e-mails (store e-mail, optionally notify receivers)

It is useful in many cases due to its flexible configuration and the ability to handle any number of quarantines and modifications sequential and conditional. Storages and whitelists used by quarantines can be managed with the built-in CLI.  

Addionally, pyquarantine-milter provides a sanitized, harmless version of the text parts of e-mails as template variable, which can be embedded in e-mail notifications. This makes it easier for users to decide, if a match is a false-positive or not.  
It is also possible to use any metavariable as template variable (e.g. storage ID, envelope-from address, ...). This may be used to give your users the ability to release e-mails or whitelist the from-address for example. A webservice then releases the e-mail from the quarantine.  

The project is currently in beta status, but it is already used in a productive enterprise environment that processes about a million e-mails per month.

pip install pyquarantine

# install service files, default config and templates
pyquarantine-milter --install

# copy default config file
cp /etc/pyquarantine/pyquarantine.conf.default /etc/pyquarantine/pyquarantine.conf

# start the daemon immediately
systemctl start pyquarantine-milter.service
```

rc-update add pyquarantine-milter default

# start the daemon immediately
rc-service pyquarantine-milter start
```

## Configuration
pyquarantine uses a config file in JSON format. It has to be JSON valid with the exception of allowed comment lines starting with **#**.  

The basic idea is to configure rules that contain actions. Both rules and actions may have conditions. An example of using rules is separating incoming and outgoing e-mails using the local condition. Rules and actions are always processed in the given order.  

### Global
Global config options:
* **socket** (optional)  
  Socket used to communicate with the MTA. If it is not specified in the config, it has to be set as command line option.
* **local_addrs** (optional, default: [fe80::/64, ::1/128, 127.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16])  
  List of hosts and network addresses which are considered local. It is used for the condition option [local](#Conditions).  
* **loglevel**  (optional, default: "info")  
  Set the log level. This option may be overriden by any rule or action object.  
  Possible values:
  * **error**  
  * **warning**  
  * **info**  
  * **debug**  
* **pretend** (optional, default: false)
